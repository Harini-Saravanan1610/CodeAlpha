The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game implemented using Python. In this project, the player tries to guess a secret word one letter at a time within a limited number of tries.

For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn (using text-based ASCII art), visually showing the player's remaining chances. The game ends when the player either successfully guesses the entire word or runs out of lives.

The game includes the following features:

Word selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.

Guess input: The user inputs one letter at a time as a guess.

Lives tracking: The player starts with a fixed number of lives (tries), which decrease with each wrong guess.

ASCII hangman art: The game displays different stages of a hangman picture after each wrong guess.

Win/Lose conditions: The game ends with a congratulatory message for winning or a game-over message showing the correct word if the player loses.

User-friendly text interface: Clear prompts and updates after each guess.

This project is great for beginners to practice loops, conditional statements, functions, and string manipulation in Python.
